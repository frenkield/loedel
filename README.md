# Simple Loedel Diagram with React

This is a very basic React application that displays an interactive
Loedel diagram.

A Loedel diagram is an alternative type of spacetime diagram that
is (maybe) more intuitive than the Minkowski diagram that is usually
used to depict systems in Special Relativity.
